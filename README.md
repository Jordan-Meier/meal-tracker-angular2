### Known Bugs

* The format in which the date is displaying is not ideal.
* Due to the fact that some meals are hardcoded, the dates listed will only reflect the date/time at which the page was loaded for those meals.

### Setup

Clone this repo on to your desktop, make sure that you have node.js installed on your computer and then:
* navigate into the project folder.
* In your terminal, run the commands:
```shell
npm install
bower install
```
* Once they are finished installing successfully, enter the commands:
```shell
gulp build
gulp serve
```
* You should now be able to view the website!

### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* SCSS
* TypeScript
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Angular2
* bower
